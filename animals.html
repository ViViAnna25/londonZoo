                        <p class="card-text"> Giraffes are the world’s tallest mammals. They have long legs, necks and even tongues - which are incredibly dextrous and purpley-black in colour (possibly to protect them from sun burn). </p>

                            <p> Giraffes act as the savannah’s alarm system.  With their long necks reaching above the treeline, they see danger first. When they start running the rest of the plain knows to run too. They can run at a pace of ten miles an hour for considerable distances and sprint as fast as 35 miles an hour in a short burst if threatened. Giraffes spend the majority of their time grazing and digest their food similarly to cows – regurgitating and chewing . They only need to drink once every few days, getting much of their hydration from food</p>
